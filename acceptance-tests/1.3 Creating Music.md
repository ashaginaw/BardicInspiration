## User Acceptance Test 1: Successful LSTM Training and Music Creation
**Please Note: you must run the user acceptance test in 1.2 before running this acceptance test**
1. In the terminal, type <code> cd BardicInspiration </code> to move into the correct directory.
2. In terminal, type <code> python -m lstm_network.py </code>.
3. A box will appear with three buttons. First, select Move Selected Songs. You should a box that appears saying the songs have been moved successfully.
4. Click Train the Model. You should get a popup once this is completed.

# Project Name: Bardic Inspiration

## Description
My project will be creating a program that will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to create new music that Dungeon Masters and players can use in campaigns. I will be adding royalty-free/free-to-use music into a supervised learning algorithm so the music can be labeled into different types, moods, or environment. Then, once the music is uploaded, I will be using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to generate the music. LSTM can handle the complexities of music generation better than other models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks. Users of the platform will be able to provide feedback which will help the algorithm create music better suited for a situation. For example, if I ask for music where my players are fighting a dragon in a cave, I would not want soft music played on a harp.

This project will be coded using Python in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Music included in this project can be found in populat video game franchises, such as The Legend Of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Mario, and more. The music used are already in a .midi format.
